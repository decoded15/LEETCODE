LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Approach: One Pass (Tracking Minimum Price)
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

'''


def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0

    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:
            profit = price - min_price
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)

    return max_profit
