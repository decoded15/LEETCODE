LeetCode 1: Two Sum
Approach: Hash Map
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

'''

def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num

        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]

        seen[num] = i
